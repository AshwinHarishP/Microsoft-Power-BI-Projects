increasing day by day.We have a locker to protect our money and physical
properties, but we do not have safty systems to protect the data which is most
confidential to us.Anywhere and anyone in the world have a possibility to steel our
data by knowing our basic details.Every year, average of 1 billion of data has been
stoled.These data’s include hospital details, banking details, social media
details,work details and etc.The sector in which data lost has been happening each
year,mode of hacking and total no.of.records has been lost in each year and the
companies which are failed to maintain the data confidentiality has been visualed
in this presentation.This dataset has more than 3000 rows.
And it has more than 25 columns.
This sheet has many attributes such as Sector name, Year,  Records lost, Organization, Organization type, Method of hacked etc.
From this dataset we can infer total.no.of data leaked by the company ,total.no.of records leaked by the company etc.
